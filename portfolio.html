  <h3>The Definition Of Beauty, Glitched Digital Art, February 11, 2019</h3>
  <p>For this piece I added first added a background to my original group image "DefinitionOfBeauty" then glitched it four times in Audacity using three different effects. I used the "Wahwah" effect from 10.0 seconds to 11.5 seconds and again at 13.0 seconds to 20.0 seconds, "Distortion" from 22.0 seconds to 25.5 seconds, and "Reverb" from 26.0 seconds to 27.0 seconds. I wanted the image to appear as if it was on a picture tube TV screen and the horizontal hold is broken, so the image appears to be falling apart or fading.</p>

    <h3>Poppin' Night Lights, Composite Digital Art, February 18, 2019</h3>
    <p>The idea is to create a city based on if it was made for a specific genre of music; I chose pop music as my inspiration to create my city. The title of the piece is “Poppin’ Night Lights” and my idea for this pop music city was to create a city that was like a dance party since pop is a genre of music that is easy and fun to dance to. I worked in Photoshop and first started with the Seattle, Washington Space Needle. Working mostly with the transform tool, I found several images to cut, paste, and resize to add into my city. These pictures include famous pop icons from both the present and the past placed on different buildings, and dancing figures from the popular dance game “Just Dance” to have a fuller representation of the genre. I also edited out the sky of the original Space Needle picture and replaced it with neon lights as well as add a layer of transparent neon stars over the entire image to make it feel more like a party.</p>

  <h3>Taking A Stroll By Water, Sound Art, February 24, 2019</h3>
  <p>For this sound piece I wanted to recreate and exaggerate what one may hear while taking a walk through a public park or a college campus. I used audio of water, steps, and casual conversation all overlayed on top of each other. The water audio is loud compared to the talking throughout the piece, which is done to replicate how conversations heard in passing are often cut off or drowened out by other noises.</p>

  <h3>Fast Slow, Video Art, March 6, 2019</h3>
  <p>In life people tend to move at a fast pace; we're always working or always in a rush to get somewhere that life passes right before our eyes. We don't often pay attention to small aspects and we need to slow down. To convey this idea, I combined several videos that are both at a fast pace and a slow pace with subtle audio to match.</p>

<h3>ToonTown Playground, Net Art, Marcg 25, 2019</h3>
<p>This website home page is a representation of my earliest memory of the internet playing the online game from Disney “ToonTown Online.” It is made to look how the game play was experienced. Players would complete tasks for rewards and use gags to defeat the game's main villains, cogs, which are robotic businessmen trying to take over Toontown. One of the game’s biggest assets was the interaction between players and from that friendships were able to form.</p>

  <h3>Impending Doom, Code Art, April 29, 2019</h3>
  <p>In light of the new Avengers Endgame movie, this piece is paying homage to the previous Avengers film Avengers Infinity War. The concept is life and death and how it can all end in a snap. We were instructed not to use recognizable characters, so we used images to represent the fallen heroes with animal based names. The images include a spider for Spider-Man, a black panther for Black Panther, a mantis for Mantis, and a falcon for Falcon. The infinity stones are rapidly bouncing around the screen to represent the chaos they create in the movie.</p>
