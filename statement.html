<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p>For my pieces, I am working with Digital Media as a medium. I have used programs such as Atom, Github, Audacity, Adobe Photoshop, Premier Pro, and Illustrator. Since the world of art is slowly shifting the idea of exactly what is considered art, I am using Digital Media to challenge both that idea and myself. I am a traditional artist, so working with DigitalMedia and learning about it along the way was fun and enjoyable as much as it was frustrating and confusing.</p>
<p>I found myself particularly enjoying Audacity and Photoshop the most. For both my Glitch Art piece, “The Definition of Beauty” and Audio/Video piece “Fast Slow,” I used Audacity for the majority of the work. My Glitch Art piece was edited four times in Audacity through uploading a .raw file of the image and using the effects in audacity to glitch the file. It was a lot of trial and error as many of the effects either produced the same glitch or glitched the image too much to a point that it was not viewable. This piece, since it was my first ever experience working with Digital Media, was challenging but I was able to make a niece piece from it. I encourage aspiring artists to try exploring Digital Media and perhaps challenge themselves to work with something new as the art world expands.</p>
